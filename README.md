# Space Exploration Page

## Description
In this guided project from the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program, I created a webpage dedicated to space exploration. The focus was on incorporating advanced CSS techniques such as background images, webp format for optimized images, and custom fonts via Google Fonts to enhance the design. Utilization of the `<span>` tag, CSS IDs, utility classes, and text-shadow effects played a significant role in styling specific components of the page.

## Technologies

- CSS

## Learnings
- Implementing background images and understanding their properties.
